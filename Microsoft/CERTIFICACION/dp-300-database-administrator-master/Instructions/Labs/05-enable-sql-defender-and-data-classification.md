# Enable Microsoft Defender for SQL and Data Classification

**Estimated Time: 20 minutes**

The students will take the information gained in the lessons to configure and subsequently implement security in the Azure Portal and within the AdventureWorks database.

You have been hired as a Senior Database Administrator help ensure the security of the database environment. These tasks will focus on Azure SQL Database.

1. On the main blade for the **AdventureWorksLT** database, navigate to the **Security** section, and then select **Data Discovery & Classification**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Data Discovery & Classification](../images/dp-300-module-05-lab-05.png)

1. On the **Data Discovery & Classification** page, you will see an informational message that reads: **Currently using SQL Information Protection policy. We have found 15 columns with classification recommendations**. Select this link.

    ![Screenshot showing the Classification Recommendations](../images/dp-300-module-05-lab-06.png)

1. On the next **Data Discovery & Classification** screen select the check box next to **Select all**, select **Accepted selected recommendations**, and then select **Save** to save the classifications into the database.

    ![Screenshot showing the Accept selected recommendations](../images/dp-300-module-05-lab-07.png)

1. Back to the **Data Discovery & Classification** screen, notice that fifteen columns were successfully classified across five different tables.
